              A collective wound suffered by the Haitians after <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal"><strong>1937 Massacre </strong></button>
deserves to be closed , otherwise , our compatriots will live sporadic incidents of the same kind in the Dominican Republic. A feeling of hatred and exclusive from some Dominicans manifested and is directly proportional to the attitude of the Haitian leaders since Stenio Vincent ( Shill Trujillo ) until now.<br>
<br>
The lack of respect for our Haitian Government and contempt for the memory of these victims say , are probably the basis of abuse inflicted not only we in the neighboring country , but also in all over the world. Selling dirt cheap Haitian labor to the Dominicans , discrimination, blatant bedsores that exist in our social body, give abroad the chance to mystify our most vulnerable fellow citizens.
To recover our lost dignity , we must fight vigorously to ensure that respect for everyone is guaranteed and reserved all inclusive Haitians. Our poor brothers and sisters are not to be indexed and treated with indignity.<br>
<br>
The inaction of our governments joined the passivity of some of our colleagues face the cowardly massacre gave a systematic abandonment of our citizens delivered to the cruelty of bloodthirsty neighbors . The shameful and degrading compensation accepted by Haiti allowed the world to believe that <strong>"HAITIAN BLOOD IS CHEAPER ON EARTH"!.</strong> What other country would like attitude and behavior in response to such a massacre? The killings had run its course as a letter in the mail and finally ended following pressure exerted by exiled Dominicans living in Puerto Rico , and the complicity of countries like Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico and the United States.<br>
<br>
The final blow was inflicted on us by our government, instead of receiving <strong> $750.000,00 </strong>compensation dollars had to accelerate transactions and pressure , attracted by the lure of the sub , decoded receiving <strong> $500.000,00.</strong> The most disdainful and humiliating it was sad statement of the famous Haitian Foreign Minister Joseph Rafael Noel before the Dominican parliament. In his speech, he had to be expressed as follows : <strong>"AROUND THIS GESTURE , MR TRUJILLO WILL BE KNOWN AS ONE OF THE MOST MEN ILLUSTRATED OF HUMANITY".</strong><br>
<br>
To accentuate dishonor, Mr Trujillo instead of facing trial for crimes against humanity, traveled to Cap Haitien by boat accompanied by Silvani apostolate Vatican September 11, 1938 under the invitation of his friend . Then the final blow was given by his second visit to Port-au-Prince in early 1939 to WISH CANON . Reading this historical version feels really humiliated and stabbed by his own government , saying the whole world to be Haitian is <strong>"WORTH NOTHING".</strong><br>
<br>
No one wants to remain a prisoner of the past and holding resentful feelings will not help the situation. <strong>October 2</strong> however must be adopted as National Mourning Day, the day when Mr Trujillo delivered a hate speech causing the massacre of Haitians. Hopefully one day we will have a museum to commemorate the Holocaust, otherwise the burning sensation, <strong>"HAITIAN BLOOD IS CHEAP"</strong> will go nowhere.<br>
<br>
I am convinced that the Dominicans themselves and even some humble hearted officials will welcome this gesture of humanism loan . I hope that someday a government will be able to close that door in the name of humanity. This is not a call wake the sleeping cat, but just to start earning this due respect.<br>
